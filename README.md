# Burning Forest Simulation

BE ADVISED! APPLICATION WORKS ONLY ON WINDOWS CONSOLE (for now...)

Description: Burning Forest Simulation allows user to find out how can a fire spread in a forest of chosen size. Software asks a user to type a size and creates a map which is two-dimensional table (size X size). Then asks for a percentage of trees in particular forest, so-called Forestation and its value can be chosen from range [0;1] (if there is an exepction thrown while entering forestation value, please try to use a coma instead of a dot i.e. "0,6" rather than "0.6"). Code conducts a simulation of burning the forest down and at then end prints final look of a map and ratio of burnt trees to initial quantity of them.

In order to run an app, go to pozarlasu\out\artifacts and create a text file. Inside copy this: 
                                                              java -jar pozarlasu.jar 
                                                              pause
Then save your text file as "start.bat" and then run a file with ".bat" extension.                                                              


From author: This simulation was my first java program that I coded after two weeks of a course at my university. It might not be perfect and maybe it could be written differently but still I have to admit that if I were to be asked how fast does it take my to learn something in terms of coding, I would show this code. The only two programs I had created before I coded this were "Hello World!" and some loops exercises.

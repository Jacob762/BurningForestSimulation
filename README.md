# Burning Forest Simulation

BE ADVISED! APPLICATION WORKS ONLY ON WINDOWS CONSOLE (for now...)

Description: Burning Forest Simulation allows user to find out how can a fire spread in a forest of chosen size. Software asks a user to type a size and creates a map which is two-dimensional table (size X size). Then asks for a percentage of trees in particular forest, so-called Forestation and its value can be chosen from range [0;1] (if there is an exepction thrown while entering forestation value, please try to use a coma instead of a dot i.e. "0,6" rather than "0.6"). Code conducts a simulation of burning the forest down and at then end prints final look of a map and ratio of burnt trees to initial quantity of them.
